# CircleCI 2.0 build image based on CentOS with Go language support

This repository contains a docker file for build image based on CentOS which contains Go lang and some basic utilities (Git, Curl, etc.). This image should work with CircleCI 2.0. This image could be find on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/scholzj/circleci-centos-golang/) and freely used, but updates are not guaranteed ;-).
